A Unity game where a cube can move

The cube can be controlled:
- By a smartphone app that displays a joystick and communicates with the game via HTTP requests (It's a bad design choice but I was learning HTTP requests)
- By a real joystick I found in my father's garage wired to the Arduino. The Arduino then communicates with the game via Serial.
